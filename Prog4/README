For music files, this creates a directory for each artist, following by a directory for each album, and renames the .mp3 file to just song.mp3
For video MOVIE files, this creates a directory for each year, and renames the .mkv file to just title.mp3
For video SHOW files, this creates a directory for each tvshowname, followed by a directory for each season, and renames the .mkv file to episode-episodetitle.mkv
For other files, just places them file in other/ and keeps the filename the same.
